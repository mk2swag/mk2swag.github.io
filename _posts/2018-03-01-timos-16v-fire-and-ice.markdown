My Name is Timo Bahr, I live in Hamburg, Germany. I am 28 years old and this is my 1991 GTI 16V Fire and Ice.
I bought this car last year in France, after my deployment in Mali, Africa because it’s very, very hard to find a original 16V Fire and Ice. I only know 2 others in Germany, and mine is in its original paint.

#### Keeping it simple
The car was on BBS RS 301 (7,5x17, et33, 5x100) with 20mm 4x100 adapters, and it had H&R Deep Coilovers from AH-Exclusive Parts here in Germany.
I sold the RS, and this year I’ll drive it with some BBS E87 with the same sizes. To fit the rims it also has the G60 fenders.

It has a brand new original grill from Volkswagen Classic Parts and I’ve also bought new Hella tail and headlights.
I like the classic look the most so for 2017 was nothing more to do!

#### What engine is it running?
I bought it with 220000km on the clock, so the plan was to drive it like I bought it in 2017 and show it at Wörthersee like it was.
<br/><br/>
After 2017, the car had to go back to the garage for some treats...
And there it is right now. I’m working on it to make the original 16V PL engine look like it looked in the first day it came out from the factory. And I might show it on Wörthersee 2018!


#### Keeping the original interior
The previous owner had some Edition One Recaros in the Golf, but I wanted it with the original seats, so I got the Fire and Ice one.

I’m working to get it with a new look, but I still want to drive it when the weather is good. There’s alway new things to do!
