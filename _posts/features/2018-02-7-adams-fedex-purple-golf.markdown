My name is Adam Haigh, I’m from Brockton, Massachusetts and this is my 1991 Volkswagen Golf.
<br/><br/>
I was at a local car meet and someone had mentioned they were selling an older Volkswagen, and it sparked my interest. I didn’t really knew much about cars at that time, but I decided to buy it anyways.

>The day I brought it home, back in June 2015, was the beginning of a wonderful passion that i have learned so much from.

It was spray painted matte black, with black teardrops and lowered on cut springs. The car was rough on the outside. It was when I started digging into it when I really fell in love with the brand. Had a great little 8 valve, and it was my first manual car.

I found out it had about 6 owners (managed to talk to 5) and it originally came from California. Went from a spray painted mess to my pride and joy. Most of the work was done in-house by me with the help of friends and if something needs to get done that I don’t trust myself to do, I don’t mind handing it off to get done correctly.

It is pretty much a rust free Californian car, that went from a Digifant 1, 8 valve engine, to what it’s currently turning into, which will be a Supercharged VR6 5 door golf.


#### Exterior Mods
First thing I had to do was get rid of the rattle canned black.
<br/>
So I had it painted Fedex purple — don’t know what led me to pick it but I absolutely fell in love with the color once I saw it.

I had my rear spoiler molded to the hatch and deleted the rear and driver side wiper. After the car was back from paint, and I had a fresh canvas. I’ve putted some cheap wheels on it and had them for about a year until I found a set of RS’ I couldn’t pass up. Once I got them, I figured it was time to get some good suspension.

I bought BC Racing BR Type Coilovers, with an extreme drop kit and custom spring rates, which I ended up modifying a little bit to get more camber adjustments for the front. I finally had the car looking how I wanted it to look from the start.


#### Engine
When I got the car it had a 1.8 8 valve, which was Digifant 1.
I do have to say that motor lasted me a lot longer than I ever thought it would. It took me all over the east coast without a hitch. Now the car is all torn apart as I’m rebuilding its new heart: a 2.8 12 valve VR6 with a v9 Vortech Supercharger with a Peloquin lsd for the o2a trans.


#### Interior
From factory, it had the stock gray cloth seats, with the rear bench seat, which I loved and didn’t want to get rid of. When I sat in the Recaros, I instantly knew I wanted them, so I upgraded the front seats to some manual Recaros out of a 92 GLI.

Then I was able to find the matching 60/40 split Recaros for the rear. I have also built a wooden trunk floor myself, which I plan to redo so i can relocate my battery to the trunk and have it hidden. I’ve also made a custom hockey stick shift knob out of a broken hockey stick I had laying around.

#### Final Notes
Right now the car is torn apart for the swap. Dashboard is out to clean up all the wiring behind. I’m having [DTM Autowerks](http://dtmautowerks.com) redoing my engine harness and I’m currently shaving the engine bay and preparing it for paint. I will be installing the [Fabless Manufacturing](https://fablessmanufacturing.com/shop/) [Mk2 VR6 Swap Kit](https://fablessmanufacturing.com/shop/mk2-vr6-engine-swap-kit-2-8l-3-2l-3-6l/), which makes me excited for not having to cut my frame rail up.

And with the tubed front crossmember I’ll be using a mk3 VR radiator that will sit flush with the upper radiator support.
<br/>
I’d love to finish the swap by mid spring and that is what I am shooting for. But there is definitely a lot of work ahead of me.
