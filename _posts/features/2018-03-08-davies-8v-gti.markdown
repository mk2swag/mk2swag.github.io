Hello Mk2Swag followers! I’m Davie and this is my project and my pop’s, from Southern California. The car we own is an original 1990 Golf 8v GTI. We purchased it in really mint condition about 3 years ago from two brothers who were (or still are) Volkswagen technicians.

When we saw the car at first glimpse, I was sold. The price was right in the range of our budget so we decided to go through with the purchase and use the car as a father and son type of bond.
We call this one [#BossMk2](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/bossmk2/) as it’s the cleanest mk2 we currently own.

The motor had about 190k on the clock with full maintenance up to date so it was like driving an old school car right off the dealer. It initially sat in a [H&R Sport Cup Kit](http://www.hrsprings.com/application/search/results/38/639/1985/) and some gold replica wheels, original quad front grill, grey interior, GTI seats and door cards.

At the moment it has a [Solo-Werks Coilover suspension](http://shop.solo-werks.com/solo-werks-s1-coilover-vw-mk-ii-85-92-mk-iii-93-98-corrado-90-94-passat-2wd-88-96/), and  [Neuspeed](http://www.urotuning.com/Swaybars-s/587.htm) front and back sway bars. The old motor got replaced with another 8v but with lower mileage. At the moment it’s sitting in 15x7 ATS Cups.
<br/><br/>
We're looking to do major upgrades for this upcoming show season such as adding a lower Hella hatch wing, replacing the quad front-end with a rallye front, switching the ATS for some 16x7.5 Azev Type A wheels in the front, 16x9 in the rear. We’ll possibly going to install an air suspension system, and in a more distant future, a Vr6 or an R32 swap will be considered as well.

Purchasing this car has been the greatest investment for many reasons. I’ve met a lot of people in the local Volkswagen community, the bond with my father has grown stronger, and it has definitely kept my budget off drugs and the streets.
