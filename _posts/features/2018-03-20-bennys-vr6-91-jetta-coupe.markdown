My name is Benny Broyles, I’m from Limestone TN and I’m the owner of a 91 VR6 Jetta Coupe I call Creamy Center.
I have owned this car for almost 14 years — it was my daily/racecar/work truck for several years, but in 2010 I pulled it off the road for a "paint job" and, well, I drove it 2016 for the first time. It just got out of hand, as these projects usually do, but this car still puts a smile on my face so she will continue to lead a plush life in my garage for many more years.

#### Starting from the exterior
The color is a custom Candy Blue on the outside, the engine and transmission are Satin Cream to match the interior. The side mirrors are custom, all the trim was smoothed and body colored, and the engine bay is all tucked and shaved.

I've  also installed the Scirocco tilt and slide sunroof, the jack flaps on the side skirts were shaved, it has a Gli rear wing, single rounds grill with the chrome strip, and the rear Volkswagen emblem was swapped out for a custom Wolfsburg one,  made from a 70s Beetle horn button.
<br/>
Regargind wheels and suspension, it’s sitting on a set of custom cut Billet and it as an AirLift V2 suspension.

The mods list goes on and on, going from these major changes to the slightest details (the cigarette lighter works as the subwoofer control knob, for example).

#### The engine
It currently runs an Obd1 VR6 from a Mk3 Jetta, with a Techtonics Tuning camshaft, a set of heavy duty valve springs and titanium retainers, a Raceland header and a Techtonics Tuning chip. The flywheel was lightened, it has an ACT clutch.

It also has a Neuspeed pulley kit, and lots of polished parts. It’s running good and it’s fun, so I’ll just keep it as is, I have no plans for boosting it or anything like that.


#### A creamy, customized interior

Inside it has a cream Mk3 dashboard, a set of Recaro power seats with billet inserts, and the rear seats were reshaped, having the arm rest deleted.
The steering wheel is from Billet and it has a set of vintage Jamex pedals.

In the back, the cargo tray was also shaved and smoothed along with the trunk itself, were the air tanks for the suspension, 3 amps, the battery and a 12” subwoofer live.

I’ve built this car for myself and I had a blast doing it, as I spent some good time with my friends and with my dad (if he hadn’t let me to keep the best spot in the shop for 6 years, nothing of this would have been possible).
