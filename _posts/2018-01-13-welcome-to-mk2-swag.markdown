My name is Adam Haigh, I’m from Brockton, Massachusetts and this is my 1991 Volkswagen Golf.
<br/><br/>
I bought it back in June of 2015. I was at a local car meet and someone had mentioned they were selling an older volkswagen, It sparked my interest. I didn't really know too much about cars at that time, but i decided to buy it anyways. It was spray painted matte black with black teardrops and lowered on cut lowering springs. The car was rough on the outside. When I started digging into this car is when I really fell in love with the brand. It had a great little 8 valve in it and it was my first manual car. The day I brought it home was the beginning of a wonderful passion that i have learned so much from.

I found out it had about 6 or so owners and the car originally came from California. I’ve talked to 5 out of the 6 and got their stories of the car. It definitely got around but the car went from a spray painted mess to my pride and joy. I’ve done most of the work in house with the help of friends and if something needs to get done that I don't trust myself to do I don't mind handing it off to get done correctly.

It is pretty much a rust free California car that went from a digifant 1, 8 valve Cali car to what it’s currently turning into, which will be a supercharged vr6 5 door golf.


#### Exterior Mods
The first thing i had to do was get rid of the rattle canned black. So i had the car painted fedex purple. I don't know what led me to pick it but I absolutely fell in love with the color once I saw it.

I had my rear spoiler molded to the hatch and deleted my rear wiper and driver side wiper. I got the car back from paint and I had a fresh canvas. I put some cheap wheels on it and had them for about a year until I found a set of rs’ I couldn't pass up. Once I bought myself some nice wheels I figured it was time to get some good suspension for her.
<br/><br/>
I bought bc racing br type coilovers with an extreme drop kit and custom spring rates, which I ended up modifying a little bit to get more camber adjustments for the front. I finally have the car looking how i wanted it to look from the start.


#### Engine
When I got the car it had a 1.8l 8 valve which was digifant 1. I do have to say that motor lasted me a lot longer than I ever thought it would.

It took me all over the east coast without a hitch. Now the car is all torn apart as I rebuild its new heart. I’m currently building a 2.8 12 valve vr6 with a v9 vortech supercharger with a peloquin lsd for the o2a trans.


#### Interior
When i got the car it had the stock gray cloth seats, with the rear bench seat, which I loved and didn’t want to get rid of until I sat in the recaros instantly i knew i wanted to swap the stock seats to the recaros. I upgraded the front seats to manual recaros out of a 92 GLI.

And then i was able to find the matching 60/40 split recaros for the rear. I have also built a wooden trunk floor myself. I plan to redo it so i can relocate my battery to the trunk and have it hidden. I made a custom hockey stick shift knob out of a broken hockey stick I had laying around.

<br/><br/><br/><br/>
Right now the car is torn apart for the swap. Dashboard is out cleaning up all the wiring behind the dash. I’m having dtm autowerks redo my engine harness. I am currently shaving my bay and preparing it for paint. I will be installing the fabless manufacturing mk2 vr6 swap kit. Which i'm excited for not having to cut my frame rail up and stiffening the front end up.
<br/><br/>
And with the tubed front crossmember i'll be using a mk3 vr radiator that will sit flush with the upper radiator support. I would love to finish the swap by mid spring and that is what I am shooting for. But there is definitely a lot of work ahead of me.
