A project created and maintained by a young digital designer from Portugal who has a great passion for this second generation of golfs and Jettas.
<br/><br/>
My first car, a 1990 Golf, was bought in July 2015 in pretty rough shape, something you can usually expect from a 400€ purchase. For my surprise the car was relatively good, mechanically speaking, and is still alive in the day of writing this. After I bought the car I immediately started to search and save a lot of images and ideas to apply to my own car and almost 2 years later I decided to open [Mk2Swag's Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mk2swag/) account as a way to share those images and also to connect with the community.
<br/>
Right now, after almost a year, the direction has changed a bit. My "inspiration images" are all shared already and I'm now focused on finding new projects and sharing them with the community, so I'm more in the side of discovering and learning with all of you, which leads me to the launch of this website.
<br/><br/>
I hope you can all enjoy Mk2Swag as much as I do, thank you for being apart of it, cheers ✌️
