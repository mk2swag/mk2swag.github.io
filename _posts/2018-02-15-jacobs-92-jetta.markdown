My name is Jacob Payne and I am the owner of this 1992 Jetta Gl.
<br/><br/>
I originally bought this car 3 and a half years ago as a broke college student looking for a cheap and gas friendly form of transportation.

When I first bought it I had no intentions on doing anything to it and was planning on running the stock 8v to the ground. Almost 3 and a half years later is has become something I can’t ever see me getting rid of.

#### Exterior Mods
The Jetta currently sits on a harder to find set of 16x8 Firebird wheels, and had previously sat on the more common 15x7 set and is lowered with coilovers.

Just about every year there is a new vinyl made for the car to keep things changing.


#### The Engine
After 40,000 miles of owning the car, I figured it was time for a change and I did a college budget build with an ABA swap.
<br/>
It has a 276 degree tt cam with an adjustable cam gear, Mk4
intake and exhaust manifold, followed by a full 2.5inch tt exhaust.

This winter the car went under the knife and is currently having the engine bay shaved and wire harnesses extended and tucked.


#### Interior
As for interior, the Jetta has a full trophy interior that was swapped in to replace the stock gray interior along with a full leather BBS steering wheel. (Unfortunately I don’t have interior pics and the car is in pieces so I can’t take any haha)


#### Final Notes
Overall, I can honestly say this car has changed my life and actually saved me a lot of money that would’ve been spend on a much more expensive car.

This car has brought me a lot of great friends and i look forward to the new show season to come.
